  <h2> Motivation </h2>
  <p>
    Poof was born out of frustration with the lack of quality of life features
    in C and C++.  Where C lacks features entirely, C++ has ergonomics ranging
    from tolerable to outrageously poor.  I wanted a quick an easy way to
    express simple transformations, primarily using strings, and sometimes
    querying the structure of the program itself.  Thus, poof was born.
  </p>

  <h2> Goals </h2>
  <p>
    Poof stands upon three main tenants:
    <h3>Be simple</h3>
    <p>
      A statement that's much easier said than done.  With the same spirit as C,
      I've tried as best I can to limit the scope of the language to simple
      features that allow a user to express what they want, how they want to.
      At present, implementations of most poof features fit on the back of an
      index card.
    </p>

    <h3>Be unintrusive</h3>
    <p>
      poof strives to be there for the programmer when they need it, and then
      GTFO.  In concrete terms this means the compiler is fast.  The code it
      generates is readable, debuggable, and mirrors the style of the project.
      If you want to stop using it at any point, it's (almost) like you never
      used it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      poof does not assume anything about the structure of your project.  You
      tell it when, where, and how to generate code.
    </p>

    <h3>Be useful</h3>
    <p>
      poof does not ascribe to any dogmatic ideas of how a language 'should
      be'.  Poof language features are born out of pure pragmatism. If it's in
      the language, it's useful for solving a real, concrete problem that users
      actually have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever wanted to quickly print an enum (or struct) value to the console?
    </p>
    <p>
      Serialize that thing to disk?
    </p>
    <p>
      Poke around in that hashtable at runtime to see what's in it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter poof.
    </p>
