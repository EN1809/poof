    Poof is a small scripting language sitting on top of a C frontend
    (lexer, preprocessor, parser).  Poof understands your C datatypes, and lets
    you operate on them at `poof` time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Basic features of poof:
    <ul>
      <li>iterate over struct, union, and enum members</li>
      <li>iterate over sets of structs, unions and enums</li>
      <li>filter types and members using builtin predicates</li>
      <li>generate new types and code from existing types</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Some simple, but useful, use cases for `poof`:
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>print enum values as strings</li>
      <li>implement generic containers & functions</li>
      <li>generate discriminated unions</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Examples of more elaborate use cases of poof:
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>generate code to printf/serialize/deserialize arbitrary datatypes</li>
      <li>generate code that statically avoids certain classes of bugs</li>
      <li>use poof as a library to write custom static analysis code</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
