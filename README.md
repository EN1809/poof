### Pre-alpha Disclaimer

Features may change or be removed without warning.  Features documented in the
examples folder are sorted in (roughly) descending order from most-stable to
least-stable.

If you to take `poof` for a test-drive I'd love to hear about it :)


# About
`poof` is a 'metaprogramming language' that aims to bring some of the niceties
of more modern languages to C.

`poof` parses a small subset of C++, so you can use it in your codebase that
makes use of operator overloading and simple templates.

`poof` requires a C++ compiler to build, though I'm making an effort to remove
the use of C++ features in favor of using `poof` itself.


# Features

- Template Metaprogramming
  - Generate new code and types from existing types.

- Datatype Iteration
  - Iterate over the members of a specified type.

- Type constraints
  - Some support for refinement types.
  - This is useful for statically avoiding a specific class of bugs which are
    otherwise not possible to detect at compile time (in pure C).
  - This has proven to be extremely useful in a small number of cases.  I
    expect to add more type constraints as `poof` matures.

- Experimental: Static analysis
  - `poof` can be used as a C++ library to build custom static analyzers.  This
    is not well documented, but if you're interested in trying this I'd be
    happy to write a tutorial.
  - The code that enables this is somewhat janky right now, but static-analysis
    is a medium-term goal for `poof`, so it will get better Soonâ„¢


# Getting started

## Required Tools to Build

`poof` depends on two submodules to build, which are themselves entirely
self-contained.  The CRT is the only external dependency, which I may remove
in the future.

NOTE(Jesse): This may not be strictly true on Windows .. I think the OS loads
some DLLs (and launches threads) that a userspace process has little or no
control over.  TBD if we care about this level of cleanliness.

### Linux

The officially supported compiler is `clang++`, version 6.0.0.  Yeah, it's
ancient, but it's what shipped on Ubuntu 18.04.  `poof` does compile, and
should work, on newer versions, but I make no promises.

### Windows

Poof requires `bash` to build on Windows.  I believe [Git for
Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) comes with a shell that should work.
You'll also need `clang++` (preferably 6.0.0), which I'll leave as an exercise
to the reader.

NOTE(Jesse): Once upon a time I targeted MSVC on Windows, but have since given
up on Microsoft products.  Clang has been reliable enough, though it is
slightly more onerous to set up.

### Mac

OSX is currently unsupported because I do not own Apple hardware.  Porting to
Apple should be a minimal amount of effort; I'd be happy to do it if someone
would donate me a Macbook.  PRs are also most welcome. Feel free to open an
issue if you're interested in OSX support.


# Building

To get the source:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/jjbandit/poof.git poof`

And to build it:

`cd poof && scripts/make.sh`


# Current Status

`poof` is currently undergoing a hardening phase before a 0.1.0-alpha release.

At the time of this writing, the tool relies on itself to generate ~15k LoC and
makes use of every documented feature.  That said, there are many combinations
of features that are left un-used, and very possibly broken.

At the moment, error messages are sometimes misleading or missing.  Generally,
UX is reasonable in some places, and highly questionable in others.

That said, helpful error reporting is a primary concern for `poof`.  I've put a
large amount of effort into writing a system that makes error reporting easy
for the language and helpful for the user.  Taking the error reporting system
and putting it to use at the language level is the final step.  The C parser
uses the error reporting system extensively, and it works great.




## Roadmap to 0.1.0-alpha

Most of the hard work of writing a C preprocessor and parser is done.  There
are still some unusual cases I've found that don't parse correctly, but for
most normal-ish code it's solid.

Once I'm satisfied with the parser, I'll move on to writing a test harness that
explicitly validates the behavior of `poof` itself.  Until then, the behavior
will continue to be implicitly specified by its own output, which is used to
build `poof` itself.

Finally, auditing error messages and completing documentation needs to be done
before releasing a 0.1.0-alpha version of `poof`.


### Feature Set
[-] Formally specify feature set for 0.1.0-alpha

- this was somewhat self-informed by the features required to build `poof`
- still somewhat TBD, but I have a mostly-complete list

### Behavior
[X] Parse include graph of `poof` (excluding CRT headers)

[X] Parse include graph of `poof` (including CRT headers)

[X] Write test suite that exhaustively validates behavior of the parser

[ ] Write test suite that validates the behavior of `poof`

### Hardening
[X] parse all C headers on my linux system

[-] parse all C headers on my windows system

[ ] parse some popular C projects: redis, sqlite, ..?

### UX
[-] Fix a laundry list of issues I have logged that result in unnecessary friction

[-] Audit error messages; find nonsensical, misleading or missing errors

[ ] Consider options for controlling whitespace in generated code.

### Documentation
[-] Write example code

[ ] Write language documentation
- For alpha this may be the same as example code, although a formal language
  specification should probably exist somewhere.


# Examples

See the [examples](https://github.com/jjbandit/poof/tree/master/examples)
folder for, well, examples of how to use `poof`.  Take note that these examples
are meant to demonstrate language features, and make heavy use of printf.  This
is not a typical use-case, but it makes visualizing the output of `poof` easier.

For less contrived examples of using `poof` have a look at the
[functions](https://github.com/jjbandit/poof/blob/master/poof/functions.h) used
to build `poof`, and their
[output](https://github.com/jjbandit/poof/tree/master/poof/generated).
